Lightning fast concurrent HyperLogLog for Rust.

## Overview

hyperloglockless is a accurate and fast lockless implementation of a concurrent HyperLogLog in Rust.

hyperloglockless is a direct replacement for `RwLock<OtherHyperLogLog<K, V>>`. To accomplish these goals, all methods take `&self` instead of modifying methods taking `&mut self`. This allows you to put a HyperLogLog in an `Arc<T>` and share it between threads while still being able to modify it. HyperLogLog puts great effort into performance and aims to be as fast as possible, even in single threaded scenarios.

## Usage

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
hyperloglockless = "0.1.0"
```
Basic usage:
```rust
use hyperloglockless::HyperLogLog;

let hll = HyperLogLog::new(16);
hll.insert("42");
hll.insert("ðŸ¦€");

let count = hll.count();
```

## Accuracy


## Available Features

- **`rand`** - Enabled by default, this has the `DefaultHasher` source its random state using `thread_rng()` instead of hardware sources. Getting entropy from a user-space source is considerably faster, but requires additional dependencies to achieve this. Disabling this feature by using `default-features = false` makes `DefaultHasher` source its entropy using `getrandom`, which will have a much simpler code footprint at the expense of speed.

- **`serde`** - `HyperLogLog`s implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` when possible.
