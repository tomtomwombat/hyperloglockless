Lightning fast concurrent HyperLogLog for Rust.

## Overview

hyperloglockless is a simple, fast, and lockless implementation of a concurrent HyperLogLog in Rust.

<<<<<<< HEAD
hyperloglockless tries to be a direct replacement for `RwLock<OtherHyperLogLog<K, V>>`.
=======
hyperloglockless is a direct replacement for `RwLock<OtherHyperLogLog<K, V>>` and is 6.8 times faster.
>>>>>>> c0ccbde (init)
To accomplish these goals, all methods take `&self` instead of modifying methods taking `&mut self`.
This allows you to put a HyperLogLog in an `Arc<T>` and share it between threads while still being able to modify it.

HyperLogLog puts great effort into performance and aims to be as fast as possible.

## Usage

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
hyperloglockless = "0.1.0"
```
Basic usage:
```rust
use hyperloglockless::HyperLogLog;

let hll = HyperLogLog::new(8);
hll.insert("42");
hll.insert("ðŸ¦€");

let count = hll.count();
```

## Performance

## Available Features

- **`rand`** - Enabled by default, this has the `DefaultHasher` source its random state using `thread_rng()` instead of hardware sources. Getting entropy from a user-space source is considerably faster, but requires additional dependencies to achieve this. Disabling this feature by using `default-features = false` makes `DefaultHasher` source its entropy using `getrandom`, which will have a much simpler code footprint at the expense of speed.

- **`serde`** - `HyperLogLog`s implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` when possible.
