Lightning-fast, concurrent HyperLogLog for high-precision, low-memory cardinality estimation.

## Overview

HyperLogLogs are a space efficient data structures for the "count-distinct problem", approximating the number of distinct elements in a multiset. [Paper](https://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf).

hyperloglockless is a lockless concurrent HyperLogLog. It's simpler, faster, and more accurate than other HyperLogLog implementations:
- âš¡**Fast:** Designed to be fast and simple in both single and multi-threaded scenarios.
- ðŸŽ¯**Accurate:** Empirically verified accuracy for *trillions* of elements; other implementations break down after millions.
- ðŸ”§**Flexible:** Can be configured with any hasher or seed, and larger sizes.
- ðŸ§µ**Concurrent:** It's a direct replacement for `RwLock<OtherHyperLogLog<V>>`. All methods take `&self` instead of modifying methods taking `&mut self`. This allows you to put a HyperLogLog in an `Arc<T>` and share it between threads while still being able to modify it.
- âœ…**Tested:** Rigorously tested and compared in [these benchmarks](TODO).

## Usage

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
hyperloglockless = "0.2.0"
```

A HyperLogLog with precision `p` uses `2^p` bytes and has an error % of roughly `104 / sqrt(2^p)`.
```rust
use hyperloglockless::HyperLogLog;

let hll = HyperLogLog::new(16);
hll.insert("42");
hll.insert("ðŸ¦€");

let count = hll.count();
```

## Performance vs Others

## Accuracy vs Others
hyperloglockless stays accurate while other implementations break down after millions of items.

## Available Features

- **`rand`** - Enabled by default, this has the `DefaultHasher` source its random state using `thread_rng()` instead of hardware sources. Getting entropy from a user-space source is considerably faster, but requires additional dependencies to achieve this. Disabling this feature by using `default-features = false` makes `DefaultHasher` source its entropy using `getrandom`, which will have a much simpler code footprint at the expense of speed.

- **`serde`** - `HyperLogLog`s implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` when possible.
